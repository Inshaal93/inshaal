# Daily needs
----
## Exercise
3 walks per day. Morning evening and night. Usually the first walk is around 10am and the last is around 10pm. 
This can vary a lot. As long as she's getting outside at least once every 8 hours for ~20 minutes. 

## Food
Feed twice in a day. If you're going on a walk soon then feed her *after* the walk. 
In her bowl spread a spoonful of wet food across the bottom. It doesn't need to be a thick layer. Then top with just enough dry food to cover the bottom. About 1/3 cup. 

All food is in the plastic bin. Refrigerate the wet food after opening. 

# Tendencies
---
- She will try to trick you take her out a million times. If you've taken her out within the last 3 hours, she's lying to you
- Be cautious with other dogs, she can be aggressive with small dogs especially. Usually she's just standoffish. You can greet other dogs but keep her on a tight leash. 
- She __will__ eat rats. Watch for it at night.
- She __will__ eat random things on the ground. Watch the floor when you're walking. 

And lastly, Nala does get depressed when I'm not around so don't be surprised if she's very lathargic and doesn't leave the room. Give her something of mine if she gets like that. A t-shirt or hoodie would do.
