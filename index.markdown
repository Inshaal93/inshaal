# Daily needs

## Exercise
3 walks per day. Morning evening and night. Usually the first walk is around 10am and the last is around 10pm. 
This can vary a lot. As long as she's getting outside at least once every 8 hours for ~20 minutes. 

## Food
Feed twice in a day. If you're going on a walk soon then feed her *after* the walk. 
In her bowl spread a spoonful of wet food across the bottom. It doesn't need to be a thick layer. Then top with just enough dry food to cover the bottom. About 1/3 cup. 

All food is in the plastic bin. Refrigerate the wet food after opening.
